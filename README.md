# Pic2Plate

## Description 

Pic2Plate is an AI powered recipe recommendation app that helps users decide what to cook based on the available ingredients in the picture.

For the MVP, the app uses Gemini 2.5-Flask to identify ingredients from the uploaded images, then prompt Gemini to suggest up to three recipes based on the indentified items.

The goal is to make meal planning faster and easier.
